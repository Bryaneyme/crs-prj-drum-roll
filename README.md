# crs-prj-drum-roll

This project was targeting DOM manipulation, and attaching eventListeners to multiple items.

I've learned:
- Basic switch/case statements (i've replaced it because i hated to use it in that particular case haha)
- Adding eventListeners and removing them, in a forEach loop. (click / keydown)
- Basic animation...? Not sure if clicking a button and highlighting it is considered animation..
- Basic JS objects (kinda looks like the python dictionaries which is cool)
- DOM manipulation such as querySelectors, attributing classes to html elements
